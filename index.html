                    <h3>RA 11934</h3>
                    <p>
                        RA 11934, also known as the Sim Card Registration Act, is a republic act that
                        seeks to end all criminal cases that are related to the uses of sim cards and
                        social media. Thus, all sim cards in the nation will have a centralized database
                        and will require everyone to register their real names and phone numbers on
                        their social media accounts.

                    <h3>New Requirements</h3>
                    <p>
                        Everyone will be given 6 months or 180 days to register their sim cards 
                        once the new law is effective. Otherwise, these sim cards will be deactivated.
                        Users will be required to present their government ID (school IDs for
                        minors) to register themselves. Violations will lead to a penalty of 
                        imprisonment from 6 months to 6 years, or a fine of 100,000 pesos to
                        300,000 pesos.

                    <h3>Public Concern</h3>
                    <p>
                        It remains unclear what social media networks are mentioned on the 
                        RA 11934, and it is impossible to keep track of the numerous troll accounts 
                        present on social media. This new law also cannot stop the stock of
                        unregistered sim cards that will be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, 
                        experts say this RA 11934 threatens the data privacy of many Filipinos,
                        leading to many possible identity frauds.

                    Aside from serious data privacy concerns, the SIM Card Registration Act
                    might also be used by some agencies (e.g. PNP, AFP) to surveil individuals
                    the govt deems to be "suspicious", "criminal" or terroristic". They'll have
                    more means to repress people's movements & expression.
